Today, I was honored to speak to 5th grade students from the Nuesto Mundo Community School in Wisconsin, Madison. It was a great opportunity to be asked questions like, what it was for me growing up as child back in Nigeria, food that I love, favorite American eatery, sports I played and still loved and why I decided to study plants. It was exciting explaining to them in simple terms what I do as a plant scientist and the contributions plant scientists make to create rich and nutritious fruits and food. They made me feel like a child again and this brought back good memories from my childhood. The black history month (February) every year is a national history month to celebrate the contributions of black American patriots who have helped shaped the nations history.
