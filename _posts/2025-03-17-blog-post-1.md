This week I find myself reminiscing about hope and gratitude to God and everyone who has helped me on my journey so far. Like every aspiring student I applied to grad school but had no funding and for one year I was juggling proposals for the journey ahead. One proposal after another I wrote. Fortunately, I got a research technician position at the Bioscience Center of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), a non-profit research centre under the United Nations Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), after bombarding multiple scientists with volunteer emails. After 2 months of extensive molecular research, I got talking with my then PI (Dr. B. Ranjana) about what opportunities exist for what crops and she mentioned Yam, but I thought I heard African Yam Bean (AYB) so when I got home, I googled the crop and immediately fell in love with it. I developed a new proposal and handed it over to my late supervisor (Dr. C.O. Ilori) and he said â€œthis is exactly what I and Dr. Michael Abberton (Director, West Africa Hub, IITA and Head, Genetic Resources Centre) were planning to work on. What a miraculous coincidence! Fast forward we set up a meeting with Michael and that was how I got funding from the Global Crop Trust, through IITA, for what will be my doctoral degree journey. I signed my appointment letter as a Graduate Research Fellow, Genetic Resources Centre on this day 10 years with so much joy!
