Sometimes, all it takes is to apply twice or keep applying for that dream scholarship, job, country, or whatever it is you dearly desire. I remember as a graduate researcher, I always wanted to do more intensive research, but funding was a major problem for almost every student of African nationality. Despite having tried numerous scholarship applications without any success, I decided to try the Norman Borlaug Leadership Enhancement in Agriculture Program a second time, lo and behold I was shortlisted this time and scheduled for a phone interview. I later realised that a component of my initial application was incomplete and that was why I didnâ€™t get it the first time. 
That was how I got into a fellowship at the University of California-Davis and the Genome Center to do cutting edge science firsthand [here] (https://caes.ucdavis.edu/outreach/geo/fellowships/borlaug-leap). The Borlaug LEAP offers fellowships to enhance the quality of thesis research of graduate students from developing countries who show strong promise as leaders in the field of agriculture and related disciplines. The program supports engaging a mentor at a US university and a CGIAR center.
