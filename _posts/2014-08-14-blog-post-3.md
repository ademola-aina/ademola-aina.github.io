I joined the Ellison Lab in June 2022 and spent a little over three years there. My primary research focus was on the Collection, Pre-Characterization, and Preservation of American Hemp Germplasm. This work contributed directly to building the newly established USDA–ARS Hemp Germplasm Repository at Cornell AgriTech, an initiative made possible after nearly a century of prohibition and regulatory restrictions. Through these efforts, I helped assemble a diverse collection of more than 1,800 accessions from 12 U.S. states. This genetic diversity will serve as a valuable resource for accelerating hemp breeding programs across the U.S., North America, and beyond. The collection provides an essential reservoir of useful alleles and superior traits for improving Cannabis for medicinal, fiber/grain, and cannabinoid uses. After 3 years and 3 months of [postdoc] (https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/2025/10/31/ellison-lab-team-updates/), I now join the University of Wyoming’s Sheridan Research and Extension Center, where I am establishing and leading mung bean breeding program for both grain and forage use. In addition, I'll be supporting the Center’s ongoing research on several other field and forage crops, including sugar beet, popping bean, field pea, chickpea, cowpea, sagebrush, and alfalfa, among others.
