I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Ellison Lab](https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/staff/aina-ademola/) in the Department of Plant and Agroecosystem Sciences at the the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I work in industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) genetics and improvement.
