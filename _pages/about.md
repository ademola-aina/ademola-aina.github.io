I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the 
[Ellison Lab](https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/staff/aina-ademola/) 
in the Department of Plant and Agroecosystem Sciences at the the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
where I work in industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) genetics and improvement.  

Previously, I've worked in the Bioscience and Genetic Resources Centers of the 
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, [IITA](https://www.iita.org/),
one of the a non–profit and research–for–development (R4D) center under the UN’s 
Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research.
