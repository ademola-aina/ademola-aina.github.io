I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the 
[Ellison Lab](https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/staff/aina-ademola/) 
in the Department of Plant and Agroecosystem Sciences at the the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
where I focus on the genetics and improvement of industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.). 


Previously, I've worked in the Bioscience and Genetic Resources Centers of the 
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, [IITA](https://www.iita.org/research/genetic-resources/),
one of the non–profit international research–for–development (R4D) center under the UN’s 
Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research. 


My research centers on improving crop genetics and breeding by leveraging genetic diversity, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, association studies (GWAS) and molecular marker development. I am particularly interested in advancing marker-assisted and genomic selection strategies, investigating the impact of abiotic stress on crop performance, and developing cost-effective, high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping platforms to enhance crop quality and yield.
