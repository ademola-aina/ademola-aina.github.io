I'm a Research Scientist at the University of Wyoming, 
Sheridan Research and Extension Center (ShREC), where I support research 
across a wide array of subjects, including forage agronomy, rangeland restoration and conservation, 
weed science, precision agriculture, and breeding in a variety of crops 
(Sugar beet, field pea, chickpea, cowpea, popping bean,alfalfa,
sagebrush and mungbean).

Former Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the 
[Ellison Lab](https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/2025/10/31/ellison-lab-team-updates/),
University of Wisconsin-Madison with focus on industrial hemp genetics (Cannabis sativa L.). Previously, 
a Research Fellow in the Bioscience and Genetic Resources Centers of the 
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, [IITA](https://www.iita.org/research/genetic-resources/),
one of the non–profit international research–for–development (R4D) center under the UN’s 
Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research. 

My research centers on crop improvement by leveraging genetic diversity, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, association studies (GWAS) and molecular marker development. I am particularly interested in advancing marker-assisted and genomic selection strategies, investigating the impact of biotic and abiotic stress on crop performance, and developing cost-effective, high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping platforms to enhance crop quality and yield.
