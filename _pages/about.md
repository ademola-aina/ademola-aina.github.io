I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the 
[Ellison Lab](https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/staff/aina-ademola/) 
in the Department of Plant and Agroecosystem Sciences at the the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
where I work in industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) genetics and improvement.  


Previously, I've worked in the Bioscience and Genetic Resources Centers of the 
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, [IITA](https://www.iita.org/research/genetic-resources/),
one of the a non–profit and international research–for–development (R4D) center under the UN’s 
Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research. 


My research focuses on enhancing crop genetics and breeding 
through genetic diversity, QTL mapping, and development of molecular markers. 
Also, I'm interested in marker-assisted and genomic selection, study of abiotic stress 
effects on crops, and the development of cost-effective and high-throughput 
phenotyping and genotyping methods to improve quality and yield.
