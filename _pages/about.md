I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the 
[Ellison Lab](https://alternativecrops.horticulture.wisc.edu/staff/aina-ademola/) 
in the Department of Plant and Agroecosystem Sciences at the the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
where I work in industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) genetics and improvement.  
Previously, I've worked in the Bioscience and Genetic Resources Centers of the 
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, [IITA](https://www.iita.org/research/genetic-resources/),
one of the a non‚Äìprofit and research‚Äìfor‚Äìdevelopment (R4D) center under the UN‚Äôs 
Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research. My research focuses on the following:
Charaacterizing and deploying crop genetic diversity to meet farmers needs,
Association studies and mapping of QTL for crop quality and yield,
Development of molecular markers for crop genetics and breeding,
Implementation of marker assisted selection and genomic breeding,
Studying the effects of flunctuating abiotic factors on crop quality and yield,
Developing cost-effective phenotyping methods for quality and yield traits,
High-throughput phenotyping and genotyping of germplasm resources.
